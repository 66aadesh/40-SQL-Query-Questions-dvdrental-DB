# Project Overview:
Title: 40 SQL Query Questions for the database 'dvdrental'

Purpose: The project aims to provide SQL learners with a series of progressively challenging SQL queries to practice and enhance their skills.

Database: The queries are meant to be executed on the 'dvdrental' database, presumably a sample database commonly used for teaching and learning SQL, containing tables related to a DVD rental store.

Levels of Difficulty:

Beginner Level: Basic SQL queries focusing on simple SELECT statements, filtering, and basic aggregations.

Intermediate Level: Queries requiring more complex JOINs, subqueries, and additional filtering conditions.

Advanced Level: Advanced queries involving multiple JOINs, subqueries, aggregations, and complex conditions.

Expert Level: Expert-level queries challenging users to apply advanced SQL concepts such as window functions, advanced aggregations, and intricate filtering conditions.

Query Structure:
Each level contains a set of SQL queries targeting different aspects of data retrieval and manipulation.
Queries are numbered from 1 to 40, providing a structured progression of difficulty.
Each query is accompanied by a description outlining the expected output or condition to be met.

Learning Approach:
Users can approach the queries sequentially, starting from the beginner level and gradually advancing to higher difficulty levels.
Each query serves as a learning opportunity, helping users understand various SQL concepts and best practices.

Benefits:
Offers a structured learning path for SQL beginners.
Provides hands-on practice with real-world SQL scenarios.
Helps reinforce SQL skills through practical application.

In summary, the project serves as a valuable resource for SQL learners seeking structured practice exercises to enhance their SQL proficiency. By engaging with the provided queries, users can gain practical experience and improve their SQL querying skills progressively.
